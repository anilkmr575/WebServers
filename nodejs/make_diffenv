-------------------------Yum installation----------------------------------------
#Node.js gets installed from the NodeSource repository which requires the EPEL repository.
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install gcc c++ make
yum -y install nodejs
#Check version 
node -v
##check npm version(NPM is the package management utility for the JavaScript programming language.)
npm -v
##Install Angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
--------------------------------Source installation--------------------------------
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.3/node-v4.2.3-linux-x64.tar.gz
#Extract the tar archive you just downloaded into the node directory
mkdir node
cd node
tar xvf node-v*.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C
##Next, we'll configure the global prefix of npm, where npm will create symbolic links to installed Node packages, 
---to somewhere that it's in your default path. We'll set it to /usr/local with this command
mkdir node/etc
echo 'prefix=/usr/local' > node/etc/npmrc
###Now we're ready to move the node and npm binaries our installation location. We'll move it into /opt/node with this command:
mv node /opt/
##create symbolic links of the node and npm binaries in your default path. We'll put the links in /usr/local/bin with these commands:
    sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node
    sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/npm /usr/local/bin/npm
###Note that, by default, /usr/local/bin is excluded from PATH when sudo is used. To change that, open the sudoers file:
sudo visudo
###Find the line that specifies Defaults secure_path and add :/usr/local/bin to the end of it.
Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
node -v
###Install PM2, process manager for Node.js applications. 
----PM2 provides an easy way to manage and daemonize applications (run them as a service).
npm install pm2@latest -g
##Runing sample js script by PM2
pm2 start hello.js
###heres all about source installation.###
